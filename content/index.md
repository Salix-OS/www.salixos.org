Summary: About Salix OS

Salix is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Slackware that is simple, fast and easy to use. Salix is also fully backwards compatible with Slackware, so Slackware users can benefit from Salix repositories, which they can use as an "extra" quality source of software for their favorite distribution. Like a bonsai, Salix is small, light & the product of infinite care.

Editions

There are six editions of Salix; the **Xfce**, **MATE**, **LXDE**, **Fluxbox**, **KDE** and **Ratpoison** editions, each edition featuring the respective desktop environment.
Salix disc images are offered in two different forms:

1. **Installation disc image:** For the direct installation of the Salix operating system to your hard drive. The installation is text dialog based, but easy to navigate and complete. It is also very fast; a "full" mode installation will take less than 5 minutes on any modern PC. All editions are available for download in both 32bit and 64bit images.
2. **Live disc image:** Allows you to boot and use Salix directly from a CD or USB drive without needing to install Salix to your hard drive. The live disc image also includes the  Salix Live installer, a graphical installer which allows you to install Salix to your hard drive from the live session. Live disc images are available in 32bit and 64bits architectures.

Installation modes
------------------
Salix has three different modes of installation:

1. **Full:** Everything that is included in the iso is installed. That includes a complete desktop environment and a complete selection of applications that matches the respective environment, always following the "one application per task" rationale.
2. **Basic:** This installs only a basic desktop environment, with very few extra applications installed on top, such as a web browser and the gslapt package manager. Ideal for advanced users that would like to install a lightweight Xfce, LXDE, Fluxbox, KDE or Ratpoison system and add their own choice of applications. 
3. **Core:** Only the minimum essentials for a console system to start are included. A graphical environment is not provided. This is ideal if you are an experienced user and want to customize your installation for any specific purpose, such as a web server, file server etc.

All three installation modes come with a complete development environment, so users don't need to add anything to start developing and compiling applications.
