Summary: A new Salix website has been launched

We finally can announce the launch of a new Salix website. It is made with [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) and the theme is based on the [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/) theme.

Furthermore the main site, the wiki and the forum now are hosted on a new server sponsored by [IP Projects](https://www.ip-projects.de/). Note that therefore our domains have changed:

* Main site: [www.salixos.org](http://www.salixos.org/)
* Wiki: [docs.salixos.org](http://docs.salixos.org/)
* Forum: [forum.salixos.org](http://forum.salixos.org/)

Redirections have been applied, so old links will continue to work.
