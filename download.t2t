The latest Salix release is built around and focused on the [Xfce #xfce]
Desktop Environment.

Older releases are available through the 
[Salix project page at Sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/salix/].

If instead of the iso images, you are looking for the packages that are
included in the Salix repositories, you can download them through one of
our [repository mirrors http://docs.salixos.org/wiki/Repository_mirrors]. 
The state of these mirrors can be seen in our 
[mirror monitor page http://salixos.org/mirmon.html].
