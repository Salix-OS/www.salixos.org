---------------

This website can be build with pelican v3.0.

Notes
-----

* The theme is based on the kernel.org theme. Source code available here: http://git.kernel.org/cgit/docs/kernel/website.git
* The Makefile has been changed to publish robots.txt and favicon.ico, too.
* The file chat/jappix.html is a static file. This means menus, headers and footers are not automatically generated. Everything has to be changed by hand in this file. Future pelican versions (>3.2) will have new options to provide a better solution.
